## How the game works

<br>The guessing game is simple</br>
<h4>First</h4>
<p>Player one will put in what they would like the answer to be (any digit, don't be too harsh ;))</p>
<h4>Second</h4>
<p>Player two will guess what the number is</p>
<h4>Thirdly</h4>
<p>player two has up to three guesses to guess the correct answer</p>
<h4>Finally</h4>
<p>If player two has not guessed the answer you will be presented with the text telling you that you have failed...</p>
<p> <s>(WIP)</s> you will then be shown the correct answer</p>
<p>If player two guesses the answer within 3 guesses you will be congratulated</p>

<h4>Would like help on how to hide the orginal answer when typed in</h4>
